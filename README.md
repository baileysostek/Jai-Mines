# Jai-Mines

This is very much a work in progress and I am using it as an example project to learn Jai the programming language created by Jonathan Blow.

## Compilation
To build this project rust run ```jai mines.jai```

## Controls
`Left Click` to reveal the contents of a cell.

`Right Click` to place a flag.

`R` to restart.

## Gameplay
I would like for the grids to generate in a formation with no ambiguity but this is not implemented yet.
